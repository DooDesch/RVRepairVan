## Features

- **"Back on the Road" questline** (default). After the RV is wrecked during the intro,
  the quest starts on its own and points you to the motel manager (Donna), who sends you
  to **Mrs. Ming**, who has you fetch a crate from a **dead drop** before she refers you
  to **Marco** the mechanic at the docks.
- **Native dialogue** via S1API: real in-conversation choices and replies, not floating
  one-line bubbles, and it shows up in the journal and the on-screen HUD tracker.
- **Referral pricing.** Marco quotes **$50,000** up front; tell him *"Mrs. Ming sent me"*
  and it drops to **$10,000**. Optionally earn his trust (a second dead-drop pickup) to
  hand over **packaged product samples** that shave the bill down further, to the floor.
- **Real carried items.** The crate and package are actual items you pick up and carry
  (with a proper icon and in-hand model). Lose one and the NPC charges a **$500** recovery
  fee to continue.
- **Repair cinematic.** When you pay, the screen fades to black, you hear Marco work on
  it (and grumble), then it fades back and he tells you she is ready. Plays in both modes.
- **Save-bound persistence.** Progress and the repaired RV are stored inside the game
  save, so they stay in sync with the world: finishing without saving (or after a crash)
  correctly reverts instead of leaving you stuck.
- **Simple mode** (`QuestMode = Simple`): skip the story and just talk to Marco, pay the
  flat repair price, and get the cinematic.
- **Configurable** prices and discounts, read live - change them in settings and Marco's
  offer updates without a restart.

## Requirements

| Component | Version / Source |
|-----------|------------------|
| Schedule I | `0.4.5f2` (IL2CPP, current Steam public build) |
| MelonLoader | `0.7.3+` |
| S1API | [ifBars/S1API_Forked](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/ifBars/S1API_Forked/) (dialogue, items, dead drops, money, save system) |
| Mod Manager & Phone App | [Prowiler, Nexus mods/397](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/397) - optional, for the in-game settings UI |

## Installation

### Recommended: a Thunderstore mod manager

Install with a mod manager (r2modman / Gale) from the Schedule I community; the
dependencies (MelonLoader, S1API) are pulled in automatically.

### Manual

1. Install **MelonLoader 0.7.3** for Schedule I.
2. Install **S1API** (its DLLs go in `Mods/` and `Plugins/` per its own instructions).
3. Drop **`RVRepairVan.dll`** into your Schedule I `Mods/` folder.
4. (Optional) Install **Mod Manager & Phone App** for the in-game settings UI.

## Configuration

Settings live in the **Mod Manager & Phone App** UI in-game, or in
`UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg` under `RVRepairVan_01_Main`.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Enabled` | `true` | Master on/off for the repair feature. |
| `QuestMode` | `Questline` | `Questline` = the full Donna -> Ming -> Marco story. `Simple` = just talk to Marco and pay. |
| `RepairPrice` | `1500` | Simple-mode price, and the price floor the questline can never go below. |
| `BasePriceNoReferral` | `50000` | Questline price if you walk straight to Marco. |
| `BasePriceWithReferral` | `10000` | Questline price after you drop Mrs. Ming's name. |
| `MinSampleDiscount` | `100` | Smallest price cut a single packaged sample can give. |
| `MaxSampleDiscount` | `500` | Largest price cut a single packaged sample can give. |

Debug-only toggles (Destroy RV, Add $10,000, Dump state, Play repair cinematic) exist only
in development builds and are not shipped in the release.

## Usage

1. Play through the intro until the RV is wrecked and the early quests have begun.
2. The **"Back on the Road"** quest appears and points you to the **motel manager**.
3. Follow it: Donna -> **Mrs. Ming** (accept her errand, grab the crate from the dead drop,
   bring it back) -> **Marco** at the body shop.
4. Ask Marco to fix the RV, drop Ming's name to cut the price, optionally do his pickup and
   hand over packaged samples for further discounts.
5. **Pay** - enjoy the repair cinematic - then go **check on the RV**.

Prefer no story? Set `QuestMode = Simple` and just pay Marco directly.

## Compatibility

- Disable other RV-repair or Marco-dialogue mods to avoid duplicate or conflicting choices.
- IL2CPP build only (current Steam public branch). A Mono build for the alternate branch is
  planned.
