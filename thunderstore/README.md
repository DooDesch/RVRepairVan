## Features

- **"Back on the Road" questline.** After the RV is wrecked in the intro, the quest starts
  on its own: motel manager (Donna) -> Mrs. Ming (a dead-drop crate errand) -> Marco the
  mechanic at the docks. Native S1API dialogue, journal and HUD tracker.
- **Referral pricing.** Marco quotes $50,000; say "Mrs. Ming sent me" and it drops to
  $10,000. Earn his trust to hand over packaged samples for further discounts, down to the
  floor.
- **Real carried items** in dead drops (a crate, a package). Lose one and the NPC charges a
  $500 recovery fee.
- **Repair cinematic** when you pay: fade to black, repair sounds, Marco grumbling, fade
  back, done. Plays in both modes.
- **Save-bound persistence** - progress lives in the game save and stays in sync with the
  world.
- **Simple mode** (`QuestMode = Simple`): skip the story, just pay Marco the flat price.
- Configurable prices and discounts, updated live.
